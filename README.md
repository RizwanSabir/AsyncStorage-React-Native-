## Introduction

Welcome to the React Native Data Management repository! This repository serves as a practical guide and implementation example for managing data in React Native applications. By utilizing GET API for fetching data from a server and AsyncStorage for local data storage, you can effectively manage data retrieval and storage within your projects.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo start
   ```
## Functionality
The application showcases a list using FlatList, which is populated with data fetched using the GET API. The retrieved data is then stored in AsyncStorage, enabling offline access and optimizing performance.

## About the Project
This project aims to demonstrate the integration of data management techniques in React Native applications. Whether you're a beginner exploring data management or an experienced developer looking for practical implementations, this repository offers valuable insights and resources to enhance your mobile app development workflow.
